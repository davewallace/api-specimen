A set of API calls to various services, for convenience.

In most cases:
1. run `npm install`
2. load up index.html in a browser

I encourage leaving a trail of URLs used to reference or inform your sample
embedded in code comments. Yes, some may rot or become out of date over time,
but even some useful reference links to your implementation might be of help to
someone else, even if only for a short time.
