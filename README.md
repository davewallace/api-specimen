# git@github.com:davewallace/api-specimen.git
A set of API calls to various services, for convenience.

# Setup

In most cases:
1. run `npm install`
2. load up index.html in a browser

# Style guide

I encourage leaving a trail of URLs used to reference or inform your sample
embedded in code comments. Yes, some may rot or become out of date over time,
but even some useful reference links to your implementation might be of help to
someone else, even if only for a short time.

Each sample should have its own dependency specification and build requirements,
platform agnostic where possible and noted otherwise.

# Contributions

In case there's a better workflow with simplicity in mind, let's have a master
branch with feature branches for new samples. When the samples get agreement
between folk, they're into master.
